üëã Hi, I'm Sebasti√°n, passionate about data, technology, and the financial world. I'm driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the search for practical solutions to complex problems through data science.

üî≠ My background as an industrial engineer and experience in financial analysis, business intelligence, and data science has allowed me to connect my technical skills with my strategic skills. I firmly believe that well-used data can transform the way organizations make decisions.

üîç In recent years, I've worked on projects related to business valuation, financial process automation, and building prediction models using tools such as Python, SQL, R, and Fico-Xpress.

üå± I'm currently studying a technology bootcamp at TripleTen, where I deepened my data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling skills.

üìà During my thesis, I developed a valuation model for Avianca Holdings during its bankruptcy process, incorporating macroeconomic variables such as fuel prices using statistical techniques in R. This project reaffirmed my interest in applying advanced analytics to real-world problems.
