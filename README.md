👋 Hi, I'm Sebastián, passionate about data, technology, and the financial world. I'm driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the search for practical solutions to complex problems through data science.

My background as an industrial engineer, along with experience in financial analysis, business intelligence, and data science, has allowed me to connect the technical with the strategic. I firmly believe that well-used data can transform the way organizations make decisions.

🔍 In recent years, I've worked on projects related to business valuation, financial process automation, and building prediction models using tools such as Python, SQL, R, and Fico-Xpress.
I recently completed a technology bootcamp at TripleTen, where I deepened my skills in data science, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling.

📈 During my thesis, I developed a valuation model for Avianca Holdings during its bankruptcy process, incorporating macroeconomic variables such as fuel prices using statistical techniques in R. This project reaffirmed my interest in applying advanced analytics to real-world problems.

What can I contribute?
✅ Analytical mindset and business focus
✅ Experience in finance, data, and optimization
✅ Ability to learn quickly and adapt to different contexts
✅ Desire to continue growing at the intersection of technology and strategy

What sets me apart?
🚀 I'm not limited to theory: I seek to apply what I've learned to generate real impact.
📚 I love self-learning and exploring new tools and approaches.
🤝 I value teamwork and multidisciplinary collaboration to build robust and sustainable solutions.

If we share interests or you think we could collaborate on something interesting, I'd be happy to connect with you here.
